# Glenaer.io Stack

## About

This is the start of work to build an automated process to
generate all the config files, including the docker compose
files, to allow a user to set up a Gleaner stack.

This stack is all the docker containers required to leverage 
gleaner to index and load results of indexing into a 
triplestore.  A simple UI is then layerd on that.

This is NOT a likely your production architecture
but rather a fully functional
core to build from.   This building will likely include 
replacing many of the components and containers selected by 
default here for ones more suited to your environemnt and 
experience tree.
