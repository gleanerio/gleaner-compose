# Cue 

## About

This is a holding place for some work I plan to use Cue
to build all the config file for a Gleaner setup.

Though gleaner is actually a small and simply stack the 
configuration points start to stack up.

- what should the docker network name be 
- persistant mounts for data
- access keys for minioi or other S3 based storage
- admin password
- memory settings
- domain name(s)
- config file locations
- https cert settings
- and more...

The goal here is to get all these little bits into one
place, answer a small set of questions and then generate
the necessary files and scripts ready to use.
